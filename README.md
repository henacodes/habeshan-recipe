## Try it yourself

If you want to try it yourself on your machine

```bash
# clone the project into you local machine
git clone https://github.com/henacodes/habeshan-recipe.git

# navigate to the folder
cd habeshan-recipe

# install dependencies
npm install

# run local server
npm run dev
```

## Building

To build your library:

```bash
npm run package
```

To create a production version of your showcase app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## Publishing

Go into the `package.json` and give your package the desired name through the `"name"` option. Also consider adding a `"license"` field and point it to a `LICENSE` file which you can create from a template (one popular option is the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)).

To publish your library to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```bash
npm publish
```

```

```
